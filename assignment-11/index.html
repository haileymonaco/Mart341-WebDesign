  I don’t know why I didn’t call myself a feminist until I was in college. I certainly was one way before then. I think we all are. I mean, really, what young girl hasn’t thought at some point that some sexist bullshit is completely unfair to women? The problem seems to be putting a name on that feeling. “Feminism” is just too scary and loaded a word for some women. Which is really too bad. Because feminism is a pretty amazing thing. When you’re a feminist, day-to-day life is better. You make better decisions. You have better sex. You understand the struggles you’re up against and how to best handle them.

    I wrote Full Frontal Feminism because I spent a really long time feeling completely confused about why more young women wouldn’t embrace something that to me was clearly the greatest thing ever. Feminism has become such an important part of my life; it’s changed me for the better and shaped who I am in tremendous ways. While I’ve always known I was a feminist, I didn’t get into it hardcore, or even call myself a feminist, until I was in college and took my first women’s studies class. My sister likes to tell me that I said (and I still somewhat refuse to believe that I ever said anything this cheesy) that the class “opened my eyes.” But I guess it really did. Without that awakening, I never would have gone to grad school, worked for women’s organizations, or started my blog, Feministing.com. I needed that one little push that let me know what feminism was really all about. Then I realized that young women don’t have enough outlets teaching them and showing them how great feminism is. Of course, there are women’s studies classes and books, and maybe some of us are lucky enough to have moms and friends who are self-professed and proud feminists. But the majority of young women only know the total-crap stereotypes. To most young women, feminism is ugly. It’s unpopular. It’s the anti-cool.

      So when I thought about writing a book about feminism, I thought the most important thing I could do was dispel the myth that feminism is anything but awesome. Because young women—most of whom, unfortunately, don’t identify as feminists—don’t know what they’re missing. And if the idea of a stereotypical feminist doesn’t exactly inspire thoughts of some secret fab life you’re missing out on, I’m here to tell you—you are missing out. I truly believe that feminism makes your life better. Imagine being able to get past all the nonsense that tells you you’re not good enough. To all of a sudden understand why you’ve ever felt not smart enough or not pretty enough. To finally be able to put your finger on that feeling you’ve always had that something is off. Believe me, to get to this place is amazing.
