1. A system font is already installed on your local device, but not necessarily available to the web. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server and do not have to be available on a user's device to appear but require certain elements to appear correctly. Web-safe fonts are fonts that developers can count on being available by the system.
2. It is important to have font fallbacks for the browsers to try to load if the primary choice font fails.
3. A main challenge for me was trying to find a fonts that I liked and that went well together. I think I did the fallback font right, however I am not sure.
