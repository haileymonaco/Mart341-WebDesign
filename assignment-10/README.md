1. The universal selector is used to style every element on the page. The element selector is to select all elements of a certain type. A class selector is a way to select elements that serve the same function. ID selectors allow for defining style rules for a specific element and are prepended with a # sign. If I wanted everything the same I would use the universal element.
2. At first I created a color palette using the coolors website, however those colors I picked wouldn't register on my page. So I ended up trying to pick colors close to the ones I liked and picked: RGB(255, 127, 80), RGB(238, 232, 170), RGBA(139, 0, 0, 0.7), and RGB(250, 128, 114).
3. I struggled with the images for this. I tried to make a grid for my page this week and struggled fitting the images into the space I gave. They are still quite small, but I am unsure how to fix it without making the grid look bad.
