Repository for my Introduction to Wed Design &amp; Development Homework
Week 2- This week I learned about directories and creating new ones. This was pretty interesting to learn about and is fairly easy to do while following the instructions, however, for assignment 2 I went in and edited my previously made responses.txt to add my assignment without following the step-by-step guide on how to do it to see if I remembered what to do. I hope I did it correctly. All of this stuff is like trying to learn a new language.
