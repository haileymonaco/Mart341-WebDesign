1. I think each webpage can only have one head and body element, however there can be multiple elements inside those elements. The head is the container for processing information and document metadata, like the thoughts of the page. The body is where everything is displayed on the viewers computer.
2. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of the document and sematic markups are used to emphasize something or to provide citations, quotations, links to definitions or showing editorial changes.
3. These week was very busy for me with traveling to Bozeman for a couple days shoot an assignment and running cameras for the debates at MTPBS. I should have started this assignment sooner, but I think I got everything I needed by going through each thing needed in the assignment, then going to the course webpage to see how to do it, and then doing it in Atom.
