1. Using the Wayback Machine, I went to YouTube's website on March 1st, 2009. It looked very different back then than it does now. It's funny because it instantly brought me back to the time when I would use it when it looked like that. I had completely forgotten it was set up in that way. The biggest thing that jumped out to me was the videos have star ratings, which I don't think they do today.
2. Overall, the last few topics have been pretty easy to understand once I do them a few times or have an example next to me as I am doing them. The thing I struggled with most this week, and I am still not sure if I did it right, was linking my about page in my index page my index page in my about page. I am unsure if I have to use an absolute URL, a relative one, or if I was supposed to use an internal link.
