1. My imaginary client was based off of my friend Sydney who loves animals and volunteers at dog shelters whenever she has free time. She wanted a simple layout and background.
2. When you're designing for mobile first, you just want the content that is being looked for and no extras to distract the users.
3. I really struggled this week. After my last few weeks of being unhappy with my websites, I really wanted to make something that looked good. I utilized the example a lot to help me go in the right direction. However, I still struggled so much with the images. I wanted to have a total of 4 or 5 images throughout my website, however only the fist image worked with the div. I tried multiple times to get the other two I knew I wanted to work with just putting in the div and imagethree for example, but it never worked. So, I just ended up using the first way we learned how to place images using an absolute url.
