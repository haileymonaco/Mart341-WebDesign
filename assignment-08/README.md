1. Divs offer a block-level element and can be singular or nested within each other. Id attributes are the "global identifier" and the id given to one element should be different from every other id on the page. The class attribute groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value. The span element is the inline equivalent of the div element. Span elements exist within divs.
2. Using a third-party service is ideal for video and audio files because it can host large, high-quality versions of the files. It is fairly simple on your end because it takes care of the encoding and compatibility details. A third-party service is not ideal for images. Using any unlicensed material without permission can be reported and it can become costly to upgrade storage.
3. I am having a couple challenges this week. The first one, that I am still trying to fix but am not sure what I am doing wrong, is my google maps will not show up on my website. Another challenge I seem to have is that when I have my index.html preview open while I am working, it sometimes doesn't show the things I have added to my website, like my audio or the media arts logo. So I am having to constantly go through github desktop to push my changes and then have to wait awhile to see if it actually worked on my website. I guess it's not a bad thing to always be checking if something worked, however it does take awhile for the changes to appear so then it just takes more time to finish the website.
