        <h3>Song Lyrics</h3>
        <p>I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say<br>

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me feels so holy<br>

I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake (No, no, no, no, no, no no no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby I can't explain<br>

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me feels so holy<br>

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushing"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushing"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance, the Rapper)<br>

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer
My heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises
Your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you
Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi hit the jet speed
When they get messy
Go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas
Or rent a Jetski
I know the spots that got the best weed
We goin' next week
I wanna, I wanna honor you
Bridegroom, I'm my Father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now
Gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leaving you like I know He ain't leaving us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us<br>

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me feels so holy</p>
