The internet is the connection of multiple networks all over the world that moves data from one point to another. 
Directories are the nesting of the folders/file system. Directory structures resemble a tree, with a single root that branches off into related groups of content. Whatever current folder you are on is the active directory, and any folders inside that current folder (directory) are subdirectories. 
Version control system will benefit me because I will be able to track the changes to my work throughout the week. I can see my history and test out different things. 
My favorite kid of art is photography.
