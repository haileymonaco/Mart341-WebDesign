1. The most difficult thing this week was styling and figuring out what I wanted. The nav element was also new this week and took a little bit of practice to get right.
2. I'm exciting to learn more about styling, but it was also pretty difficult for me this week so hopefully next week it will click with me and start making more sense.
3. This week was hard for me to get started. I just kept looking at my screen and getting frustrated that I didn't know what style I wanted or where to even begin, but I overcame that once I just told myself to start working on it.
